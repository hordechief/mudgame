All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:
VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"


This is Demo 17.3, a demonstration of linking C++ code to Python code, so that
you can call python code from C++, and call C++ code from Python.
