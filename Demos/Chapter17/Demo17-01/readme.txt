MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:
VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"


This is Demo 17.1, a demonstration of making your own Python interpreter.
Just run it and enter any python code you want. It won't print anything out unless
you tell it to, however.
