MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:
VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"


This is Demo 2.3, which runs a simple internet server.
This is a better version of Demo 2.1; this server accepts input from a client
and prints it back out.
To use this demo, run it, and then connect to this demo using Demo 2.4
