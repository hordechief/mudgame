MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:
VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"


This is Demo 2.1, which runs a simple internet server, named "Hello Internet!"
You should run this, and then run Demo 2.2 to connect to the server.
