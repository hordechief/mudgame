MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:

VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"

Note: Most of the Demo files available require installation to your hard drive since they save data to disk and this can't be done when they are run from the CD-ROM.
