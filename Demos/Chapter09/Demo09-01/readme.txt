MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


All of the demos in this book can be compiled by following these procedures:
VC6: open up the .dsw file, and hit compile
VC7: open up the .sln file, and hit compile
GCC: type "make"


This is Demo 9.1, a better version of SimpleMUD.
This demo adds rooms, stores, and training rooms.
