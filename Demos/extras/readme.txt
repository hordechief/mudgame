MUD Game Programming
(C) 2003 Ron Penton


This is the Extras directory. In it is a partially complete file editor for SimpleMUD.
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to complete it, and it only supports editing players
and items. I will make an effort to complete this on my own time, and you should
be able to find it on my website at http://ronpenton.net/MUDBook/

This uses the WXWindows GUI library, and only compiles on Windows (that I tested, it
may very well work on other OS's). You can find the full WXWindows library for free
at http://www.wxwindows.org
